# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Context

This is a fresh project directory (`ai_gen`) located in `F:\Documents\project\` with SuperClaude framework integration. The project currently contains no source code or technology stack - it is in the initialization phase.

## SuperClaude Framework Integration

This project is configured with the advanced SuperClaude framework, featuring:

### Available Commands
- `/build` - Project builder with framework detection and auto-configuration
- `/implement` - Feature implementation with intelligent persona activation
- `/analyze` - Comprehensive code and system analysis
- `/improve` - Evidence-based code enhancement
- `/design` - Design orchestration with architectural focus
- `/test` - Testing workflows with multiple frameworks
- `/task` - Long-term project management

### Persona System
The framework includes 11 specialized personas that auto-activate based on context:
- `--persona-architect` - Systems architecture and scalability
- `--persona-frontend` - UI/UX and accessibility
- `--persona-backend` - Reliability and API design
- `--persona-security` - Threat modeling and compliance
- `--persona-analyzer` - Root cause analysis
- `--persona-performance` - Optimization and bottleneck analysis
- `--persona-qa` - Quality assurance and testing

### Advanced Features
- **Wave Orchestration**: Multi-stage execution for complex operations (auto-activates at complexity â‰¥0.7)
- **Sub-Agent Delegation**: Parallel processing for large-scale operations (>7 directories or >50 files)
- **MCP Integration**: Context7 (documentation), Sequential (complex analysis), Magic (UI components)
- **Quality Gates**: 8-step validation cycle for all operations

## Project Initialization Guidance

Since this is a fresh project, consider these initialization approaches:

### 1. Technology Stack Detection
```bash
# Use build command to auto-detect and setup technology stack
/build initialize --detect-stack
```

### 2. Architecture-First Approach
```bash
# Design system architecture before implementation
/design system-architecture --persona-architect
```

### 3. Security-By-Design
```bash
# Implement security considerations from the start
/implement security-foundation --persona-security --validate
```

## Development Principles

Based on the SuperClaude framework configuration, follow these principles:

1. **Evidence-Based Development**: All decisions should be supported by verifiable data
2. **Quality First**: Use the 8-step validation cycle for all code changes
3. **Security by Default**: Implement secure defaults and threat modeling
4. **Performance Awareness**: Consider performance implications from the start
5. **Systematic Approach**: Use structured methodologies for complex problems

## Next Steps

1. Determine the project type and technology stack
2. Set up the development environment and build system
3. Establish testing framework and quality gates
4. Create the foundational architecture
5. Implement core functionality with proper validation

## Important Notes

- This project inherits global configuration from `C:\Users\Administrator\.claude\`
- All operations should follow the SuperClaude framework rules and principles
- Use absolute paths for all file operations (`F:\Documents\project\ai_gen`)
- Enable appropriate personas and MCP servers based on task requirements
- Always validate operations before marking tasks as complete
